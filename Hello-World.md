Hello World - Python
===

I have started coding in Python a few months ago, and I have enjoyed learning a new language in the coding world. Learning Python is both fun and simple especially with the Computer Program; Pycharm. I recommend using the Pycharm Program because it is easier to program than other tools.

**Python** is a Programming Language that can be used for many different activities, such as; Software Developing, Control and Management, Game Development, Data Analysis and many areas of coding. You can learn the basics of Python by using the teaching website called w3schools.

You can put in the simple code shown as following; 
print("hello World!").  
This code contains only letters/words so double quotations are used on both sides. This code can be used for many nearly any code.    
![hello-world](https://github.com/Avashdk/Python/blob/master/media/Numeric.png)  



In this Code you can see that there are only numbers, it is called a numeric value, if you want to multiply the number you need to use the * sign. You do not need double quotations because it does not contain text.
